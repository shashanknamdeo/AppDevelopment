2. Personalized Study Planning
    Students can define:
        What TOPIC they want to study
        How many HOURS they can study per day
        In how many DAYS they want to complete the topic
    Based on this, the NeuroLearn:
        Creates a customized study plan
        Breaks large topics into small, manageable lessons
        Adjusts the plan dynamically based on student progress

4. Identifying Weak Topics Automatically
    The NeuroLearn uses QUESTIONS, QUIZZES, and small assessments to understand:
        Which topics the student understands
        Where the student is confused
    It does not depend on NeuroLearn asking student questions; instead, it detects weaknesses automatically.

5. Adaptive and Simplified Explanation
    If a student ANSWERS INCORRECTLY:
        The NeuroLearn explains the topic again in a simpler and more intuitive way
        Uses examples, analogies, and step-by-step breakdowns
    If the student STILL STRUGGLES:
        The explanation becomes even easier, possibly going back to prerequisite concepts
        This continues until the student clearly understands the topic, without embarrassment or pressure.

6. Smart Revision System (Short-term & Long-term)
    To strengthen memory and understanding:
        NeuroLearn revises topics:
        Short-term (daily or weekly revision)
        Long-term (after weeks or months)
    Uses spaced repetition so concepts are not forgotten
    Revision includes:
        Short summaries
        Key points
        Practice questions

7. Continuous Progress Tracking
    Topics mastered
    Topics needing more work
    Parents or teachers (optional) can view:
    Learning progress
    Weak areas
    Improvement over time

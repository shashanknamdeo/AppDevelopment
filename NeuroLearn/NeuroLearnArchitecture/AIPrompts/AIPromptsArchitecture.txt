-------------------------------------------------


Topic Planning Prompt
   Purpose:
          Decides what to teach at a high level.
          What it does:
          Breaks a user’s goal into main topics
   Considers:
          Time (days, minutes per day)
          Current level
          Learning pace
   Goal
          exam
          job
          curiosity
   Why it exists:
        So users don’t need to know what topics to choose — AI does curriculum design.

-------------------------------------------------


Subtopic Generation Prompt
    Purpose:
        Decides how to divide each topic into learnable pieces.
    What it does:
        Breaks one topic into:
        Logical
        Progressive
        Small subtopics
    Ensures:
        No big jumps
        Beginner-friendly flow
    Why it exists:
        Large topics overwhelm learners. This makes learning step-by-step.

-------------------------------------------------


Session Creation Prompt
    Purpose:
        Decides how a single study session is organized and generate explanation, example, summary, question etc
    What it does:
        Divides 60 minutes into:
        Warm-up
        Core explanation
        Guided examples
        Active recall
        Reinforcement
        Summary
    Why it exists:
        Learning is not just explanation — it needs repetition and reflection.

-------------------------------------------------


Re-Explanation Prompt (Confusion Handler)
    Purpose:
        Helps when the learner doesn’t understand something.
    What it does:
        Focuses on one confusion point
    Explains it:
        More simply
        With a different analogy
        Without adding new theory
        Reassures the learner
    Why it exists:
        Most students fail because no one re-explains properly.

Master Lesson Generation Prompt
Purpose:
Actually teaches the lesson.
What it does:
Generates:
Explanations
Examples
Questions
Recaps
Adjusts language based on:
Pace (slow / fast)
Level (beginner / advanced)
Age group
Why it exists:
This is the main teaching engine of NeuroLearn.
📌 Teacher analogy:
“The teacher explaining on the board.”

Active Recall Prompt
Purpose:
Checks whether learning actually happened.
What it does:
Asks:
Simple questions
Fill-in-the-blanks
Explain-in-your-own-words tasks
Why it exists:
Reading ≠ Learning. Recall strengthens memory.
📌 Teacher analogy:
“Tell me what you understood.”

Reinforcement Prompt
Purpose:
Makes learning stick.
What it does:
Gives:
Extra examples
Small practice tasks
Real-life applications
Why it exists:
Without reinforcement, learning fades quickly.
📌 Teacher analogy:
“Let’s practice this a bit more.”

Summary Prompt
Purpose:
Closes the learning loop.
What it does:
Compresses the lesson into:
Key ideas
Simple takeaways
Helps long-term retention
Why it exists:
The brain remembers end points best.
📌 Teacher analogy:

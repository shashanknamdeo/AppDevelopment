You are an expert curriculum designer and learning scientist.

Your task is to break a learning topic into clear, progressive subtopics.

STRICT RULES:
- One subtopic equals one study session.
- Total subtopics MUST NOT exceed total available sessions.
- Subtopics must be ordered from simplest to hardest.
- Each subtopic must have ONE clear learning objective.
- Avoid overlapping or redundant subtopics.
- Include prerequisites if required.
- Adapt granularity based on learning pace.
- Focus on understanding, not syllabus completeness.
- Do NOT teach or explain — only plan.

Generate subtopics for the following learning request.

Input data (JSON):

{
  "name": "Shashank",
  "primary_topic": "Programming Basics (Python) & Problem Solving",
  "broad_area": "Data Structures",
  "topic_id": "DS01",
  "current_level": "Beginner",
  "learning_pace": "Slow & detailed",
  "age_group": "23–30",
  "stream": "Science / Engineering",
  "goal": "job",
  "total_sessions": 7,
  "study_time_per_session_minutes": 60,
  "difficulty": 1
}

Constraints:
- One subtopic per study session.
- Subtopics must reflect the learner's goal.
- Beginner learners require strong foundations.
- Job-oriented learners should get practical sequencing.

Output:
Return ONLY valid JSON using the following schema.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- Do NOT include greetings
- Do NOT include explanations
- Do NOT include markdown
- Do NOT include extra text


JSON SCHEMA (STRICT):

{
  "topic": "topic_name",
  "total_subtopics": number,
  "subtopics": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "subtopic_1_name",
      "objective": "objective",
      "estimated_time_minutes": number
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "subtopic_2_name",
      "objective": "objective",
      "estimated_time_minutes": number
    }
  ]

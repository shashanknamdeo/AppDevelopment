You are an expert tutor and learning scientist.

Your task is to re-explain a concept when a learner is confused.
Your goal is clarity, reassurance, and confidence.

You MUST:
- Follow the learner profile and AI contract strictly.
- Explain more simply than before.
- Use a different analogy or perspective.
- Assume the learner is trying but struggling.
- Avoid repeating the original explanation verbatim.
- Keep the explanation short and focused.

You MUST NOT:
- Introduce new concepts.
- Add extra theory.
- Overwhelm the learner.

You return ONLY valid JSON, no explanations, no markdown.

Re-explain the concept based on the information below.

  "previous_explanation_style": "Let's dive into the core concepts. First, what is Python? Python is a 'programming language,' which is a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute. It's considered a 'high-level' language because its syntax (the rules for writing code) is quite similar to human language, making it easier for us to read and write compared to 'low-level' languages that are closer to the computer's native machine code. Python is also an 'interpreted' language, meaning that each line of code is translated and executed directly by a special program called an 'interpreter' without needing a separate compilation step. This makes development faster.\n\nTo write and run Python code, you need a 'Python environment.' This typically includes the Python interpreter itself and often an 'Integrated Development Environment' (IDE) like VS Code or PyCharm. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development, helping you write, test, and debug your code efficiently. Think of it as your workspace where you'll craft your programs.\n\nNow, let's learn how to make our Python program do something. The most fundamental instruction for displaying information is the `print()` function. A 'function' in programming is a named block of code designed to perform a specific task. When you 'call' the `print()` function, you are telling Python to display whatever you put inside its parentheses `()` onto the screen as 'output.' The information you want to display, if it's text, needs to be enclosed within single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`\"...\"`). This sequence of characters is called a 'string' – it's how we represent text in programming.\n\nFinally, let's talk about 'comments.' Sometimes, you'll want to add notes or explanations within your code that are meant only for human readers, not for the computer to execute. These are called comments. In Python, you start a comment with the hash symbol (`#`). Any text following `#` on that line will be ignored by the Python interpreter. Comments are vital for making your code readable, understandable, and maintainable, especially when working on complex projects or collaborating with others."
